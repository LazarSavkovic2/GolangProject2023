# GolangProject2023

Ported the Java-based plane identification system to Golang, adapting the logic to fit 

within a procedural programming paradigm. Streamlined the translation process to accommodate Golangâ€™s syntax and static 

typing, enhancing the program structure for increased efficiency. Optimized the data processing pipeline, achieving a reduction in execution time 

through concurrency and efficient memory management inherent to Golang.
